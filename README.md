Slash Ninja
Feb 2020

## Project description
A One-week group project developed after classes in our “spare-time”.

## The Idea
The game started from cutting cannon balls, but then it was thought who they were attacking, it was there when the idea of Slash Ninja came, a ninja that was being attacked by cannon balls.

## The Development
The first step was deciding what the project was going to be about, after which we charted the gameplay and assessed what entities we were going to need in order to build it. The UML was designed and the game skeleton was created from it.
We then assigned tasks to each team member and implemented all gameplay features, after which we designed and incorporated a graphical interface using SimpleGraphics library.

## My Role
We tried to distribute responsibilities as evenly as possibly across team members. Together with a partner we had the job of making the mouse move and click without problems on the game graphic, as well as the images that were going to appear. Make some designs for the final presentation.

## Tech && Methodologies
Java, IntelliJ, Ant.
